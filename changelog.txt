    Little bit of cleaning..
Info:
  This pack update cleaned the modpack a bit so that working on it would be easier and that it would take less space and resources from players.
  Next up is making guides, quests, progression and that sort of things. Some other things will also happen but will take a while.
  Oregen is going to be a bit late from schedule, but will be done once there is time for it. Had to just fix the oregen so cofh wouldn't spam about json problems.
  Pack will probably be released at 0.1.0 update.
==============
Version: 0.0.2
Date:  22.5.17
Stage:   Alpha
Info:
Just a quick cofig update.
Made a config check and found out that many configs had to be changed.
Oregen changes happening, soon pack will be playable but not at all done.
So soon this pack will be published but it will get large updates along the way of making it.

Date:  <22.5.17
Stage:    Alpha
Info:
Project name change.
All things done are still present, but versioning starting over.
Pack has now many new things to look out for.
We also have made the mod count a bit smaller so that the pack loads faster and we can have a more lagless pack.
Here's some of the changes:
+HardLib
+HarderOres
+HarderWildlife
+Expanded Industry
+CustomOreGen (only because otherwise we cant use the harder* mods)
